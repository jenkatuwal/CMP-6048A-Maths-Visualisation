Python Version: 3.8/3.9
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-399/

To Run in python interpreter (If chose not to run exe):

1. Clone the Repo
2. Make sure you have python 3.8 or 3.9 installed on your machine (make sure you add to PATH during install).
3. Navigate to the directory that contains main.py and requirements.txt in shell.
4. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in shell. (You may want to run this as Admin in shell).
5. Run the application by running 'python main.py' in shell, or open using your IDE of choice and run main.py.

Notes:

The main.py contains the code for the GUI, inside 'modules/' is where we have coded our lexer/parser and other GUI windows. There are also some custom QT widgets coded in there too.
'GUI/' contains stylesheets and python QT files for our GUI windows. 'images/' is self-explanatory.
